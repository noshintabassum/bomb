/*	In Chefland, there are N houses numbered from 1
    to N, i-th house has a defence system having strength Ai.

    Chef suspects a bomb drop on one of the houses very soon.
    A bomb with attack strength X can destroy the i-th house,
    if the defence system of the i-th house Ai, is strictly less than X.

    Also, when the i-th house is destroyed due to the bomb, all
    houses with indices j such that 1â‰¤j<i get destroyed as well
    irrespective of their defence system.

    Given one bomb with attack strength X, find the maximum number of houses that can get destroyed.
